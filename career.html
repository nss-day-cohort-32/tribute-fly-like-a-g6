                    By the mid-1970s Williams was guest starring on several television shows, including The Richard
                    Pryor
                    Show and Laugh-In. After guest appearances as the alien Mork on Happy Days, Williams was given his
                    own
                    show, Mork & Mindy (1978–82). The series offered Williams the opportunity to transfer the enthusiasm
                    of
                    his stand-up performances to the small screen and provided an outlet for his prolific
                    improvisational
                    talents. Mork & Mindy proved an immense success and was instrumental in launching Williams’s film
                    career. Williams’s early movie appearances included leads in Popeye (1980) and The World According
                    to
                    Garp (1982), but his first major role came with Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), in which he portrayed
                    the
                    irreverent military disc jockey Adrian Cronauer. The role earned Williams his first Academy Award
                    nomination. His second came soon after for his performance as an inspirational English teacher at a
                    preparatory school in Dead Poets Society (1989). In the early 1990s he lent his talents to a number
                    of
                    successful family-oriented films, including Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), in which he played a divorced man
                    who
                    impersonates a female nanny in order to be close to his children, and the animated feature Aladdin
                    (1992), in which he voiced a frenetic genie.

                    While undoubtedly a successful comedic actor, Williams was equally adept at more-sober roles. He
                    played
                    a distressed former professor in The Fisher King (1991) and a psychiatrist who mentors a troubled
                    but
                    mathematically gifted young man (played by Matt Damon) in Good Will Hunting (1997). Both films
                    earned
                    Williams Academy Award nominations, and for Good Will Hunting he finally received an Oscar. As his
                    career progressed, Williams continued to take both comedic and serious roles. He starred as a doctor
                    who
                    attempts to heal his patients with laughter in Patch Adams (1998) and portrayed a psychotic
                    photo-lab
                    technician who stalks a suburban family in One Hour Photo (2002). A 2002 stand-up performance led to
                    the
                    hugely successful Robin Williams: Live on Broadway (2002), which was released as both an album and a
                    video. He later portrayed Teddy Roosevelt in the comedy Night at the Museum (2006) and two sequels
                    (2009, 2014). He provided voices for the animated films Happy Feet (2006) and Happy Feet Two (2011).
                    Williams was sidelined with heart problems in early 2009, but he returned to work shortly
                    thereafter,
                    promoting his films and resuming his Weapons of Self-Destruction comedy tour. Later that year he
                    starred
                    in the family comedy Old Dogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2011 Williams—who had appeared in a 1988 Off-Broadway production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for
                    Godot—made his Broadway acting debut in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a surreal comic drama set
                    during the Iraq War. In 2013 he returned to movies, portraying a priest in the star-studded farce
                    The Big Wedding and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Lee Daniels’ The Butler. The TV series
                    The Crazy Ones, in which he played the head of an ad agency, premiered later that year; it was
                    canceled in 2014. Williams then portrayed a man who attempts to reconcile with friends and family
                    following a terminal diagnosis in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn (2014). Boulevard (2014),
                    in which he played a closeted gay man who befriends a male prostitute, was released after his death.
